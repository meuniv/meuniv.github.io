Installation
++++++++++++
There is no installation needed as this is a simply Python script.

Just make sure to have a:

1. Working Latex environment in place
2. Python installed

If you use specific Latex packages in your mathematical formulas, you will need to edit the python script directly (work in progress to make this process simpler).
