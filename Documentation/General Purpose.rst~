General purpose
+++++++++++++++
The purpose of this tool is to convert a `yaml` file into a file usable for 
multiple-choice questions in LMS. The code also creates latex file as needed. 

Functionalities
---------------

1) Creation of files needed for integration with LMS or Canvas
2) Creation of latex files using the Exam package
3) Creation of latex files with answer keys
4) Spellchecking

Installation
------------
There is no installation needed as this is a simply Python script.

Just make sure to have:

1. A working Latex environment in place
2. Python installed

If you use specific Latex packages in your mathematical formulas, you will need to edit the python script directly (work in progress to make this process simpler).
